# English Grammar notes

## Từ loại

There are eight kinds of words, called **parts of speech**:

1. Nouns
2. Pronouns (đại từ)
3. Adjectives
4. Verbs
5. Adverbs phó từ, trạng từ, trạng ngữ
6. Prepositions: giới từ
7. Conjunctions: liên từ
8. Interjections: thán từ

Besides, there are three special form of the verb called **double parts of speech**: The Gerund, The Participle and The Infinitive (Coi thêm trong phần "Verb").

Danh từ đơn vị = lượng từ, quantifier

- prefix: tiền tố
- suffix = postfix meaning the end of the word, hậu tố.
- ["Postfix" or "suffix"?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/81263/postfix-or-suffix)

## Sentence structure

- clause: mệnh đề
- phrase: cụm từ

**Subordinate Clauses** (dependent clause) không thể đi một mình

- subject: chủ ngữ
- predicate: vị ngữ
- verb
- object: tân ngữ, túc từ
- **complement**: required for the **completeness** of the sentence; đặt sau NOUN, mô tả tình trạng **mới**.
- **modifier** (thành phần phụ nghĩa): optinal, add extra informations, đặt trước NOUN, mô tả tình trạng **cũ**.

According to the formation of the Predicate, sentences may be classified into **FIVE BASIC SENTENCE PATTERNS**:

1. `S + V`; plus optional Verb Modifier
2. `S + V + SC` (Subject Compliment); the verb is called **linking verb**
3. `S + V + O` (Object)
4. `S + V + iO + dO` (Indirect Object + Direct Object)
5. `S + V + O + OC` (Object Compliment)
anki
The main sentence elements are `subject, verb, object and complement`. Besides, other words or groups of words called modifiers are used to tell more about the main elements.  
Every main sentence element may take one or more modifiers:

- Subject Modifier `SM`
- Verb Modifier `VM`
- Object Modifier `OM`
- Direct Object Modifier `dOM`
- Indirect Object Modifier `iOM`
- Subject Complement Modifier `sCM`
- Object Complement Modifier `oCM`
- Modifier of another Modifier `mM`

4 kinds of sentences:

- Classification according to the meaning:
  1. Statements
  2. Questions
  3. Commands
  4. Exclamations
- Classification according to the structure:
  1. Simple Sentences (câu đơn): only one Independent Clause (IC)
  2. Compound Sentencess (câu ghép): two/more clauses joined by **co-ordinating conjunctions** (`AND BUT OR NOR SO`)
  3. Complex Sentences (câu phức): one main clause + ONE/more SUBORDINATE clause joined by **Subordinating Conjunctions**.
  4. Mixed Sentences (Compound-complex sentence, Câu phức tổng hợp): TWO/more main clause + ONE/more SUBORDINATE clauses.

- I woke up at six o'clock because I had to hit the gym, but I was too tired to get out of bed.
- Last night, I ate a lot when I got home, but I was still hungry, so I went to the shopping center to buy some more food.

## Subject

Object of Preposition (tân ngữ của giới từ) is a noun or pronoun that follows a preposition and completes its meaning. If a word is an object of a preposition, it is not the subject.

An **appositive** is a noun that comes before or after another noun and has the same meaning. If a word is an appositive, it is not the subject.

## Particle & Phrasal Verbs

The fundamental idea of the **particle** (tiểu từ) is to add context to the sentence, expressing a mood or indicating a specific action.

A particle is a word that has a grammatical function but does not fit into the main parts of speech (i.e. noun, verb, adverb).

Particles do not change.

The infinitive `to` in `to fly` is an example of a particle, although it can also act as a preposition, e.g. `I'm going to Spain next week`.

Many words can be described as particles, e.g. conjunctions such as 'and' and 'but' and interjections such as 'oh' and 'wow'. Particles appear frequently in the teaching of **phrasal verbs**, which can be grouped for teaching purposes by particle, e.g. 'off', 'on', 'out' etc.

**Phrasal Verbs** (cụm động từ) are made up of a verb and a particle. The particle often changes the meaning of the verb.

- `They've called off the meeting.` (call off = to cancel)

- It looks like rain today.
- That coat looks expensive.

## Nouns

- man (singular) > men (plural) => "a" = a man (singular); human
- woman (singular) > women (plural) => "e" = **E**very man (plural)
- foot / feet
- tooth / teeth
- fish / fish (same as singular)

“Madam” or “Ma’am” would be the only ways for older children and adults to address a woman, with “Ma’am” usually reserved for addressing someone of high social rank.

uncle - aunt; nephew - niece

- For singular nouns: each, every, single, one, a
- For plural nouns: both, two, many, several, various

Keywords for countable and un-countable nouns:

- For countable nouns: many, number, few, fewer
- For un-countable nouns: much, amount, little, less

- `the` is the definite article
- `a/an` are the in-definite articles

Plurals of Compound Nouns:

- Normally, the final element is made plural:
  - housewife - housewives
  - girlfriend - girlfriends
  - match-box => match-boxes
- When MAN or WOMAN is the first element, both elements are made plural:
  - manservant - menservants
  - woman-doctor => women-doctors
- Only the first element is made plural when the first element is a noun, and the second element is a PREPOSITION, ADJECTIVE, or ADVERB:
  - father-in-law => fathers-in-law
  - court-martial => courts-martial
  - passer-by => passers-by

apposition (đồng vị ngữ)

### Noun Phrases

Khi dùng phrases phải tránh lỗi **Dangling Constructions**.

Gerund & Infinitie có thể được dùng như noun:

- **Listening to music** is her hobby. => Gerund nói về một thực tế
- **To form a good habit** is very hard. => Infinitive chỉ việc chưa xảy ra

### Noun Clauses

Noun clause connectors:

- what, when, where, why, how
- whatever, whenever
- whether, if
- that

- Chữ `wherever` có `e` ở cuối nên chỉ cần thêm `ver` thay vì thêm `ever` sẽ thành `whereever` là sai  
- what => what+ever
- when => when+ever

A **Noun clause connector** can also be the subject of the clause at the same time: whoever, whatever, whichever, who, what, which.

Verb trong dependent clause cũng conjugate như một independent clause.

### Pronouns

- Subject pronouns: I,  you, he,  she, it, we, they
- Object Pronouns:  me, you, him, her, it, us, them

- Possesive adjective: my,   your,  his, her,  its, our,  their
- Possessive pronouns: mine, yours, his, hers, --   ours, theirs

Everyone must give their* name.  
=> Everyone must give his or her name.

If a person really wants to succeed, he or she must always work hard.  
If anyone stops by while I am at the meeting, please take a message from him or her.

## Adjective & Adverbs

- Adjectives have only one job: they describe nouns or pronouns.
- Adverbs (trạng từ) do three different things. They decribe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- Adverbs **do NOT** affect verb agreement

- Examples of Adverb:
  - He `always` goes home late.
  - `Personally`, I can `always` help you `willingly here every day`.
  - Man `always loves` freedom.
  - Man `has always` fought aginst the weather.
  - The middle-aged man `still remains` unmarried.
  - She `usually gets up` early.

Generally when a word ends in `-ly`, it is an adverb. However, there are a few words ending in `-ly` that are **adjectives**, and these `-ly` adjectives can cause confusion. Example: `costly, likely, daily, early, lively, weekly, friendly, lonely, monthly, kindly, manly, ...`.

A **prepositional phrase** (cụm giới từ) is a group of words beginning with a preposition (like "in," "on," or "at") and includes its object and any modifiers, forming a single unit that functions as either an adjective or an adverb to add detail or clarify relationships within a sentence.

- Use `year-old` (hyphenated) when the phrase acts as a **compound adjective** describing a noun (e.g., `a 5-year-old child`) or as a noun itself (e.g., "The 5-year-old ran into the room").
- Use `year old`` (no hyphens) when simply stating a person's age after a noun, which is usually the verb "is" (e.g.,`The child is 5 years old`).

Compound adjectives & nouns:

- Vietnam is a **rice-producing** country.
- She told him he was a lazy **good-for-nothing** and should get a job. (Compound Noun)
- The **commander-in-chief** is killed during battle. (Compound Noun)
- I am a **fifth-year** student.

### Adjective Phrases

A **preposition** (giới từ) is a word that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence, often indicating location, time, or direction. Common examples include **in, on, at, to, from, of, by, behind**. Prepositions are essential for clarifying the connections between different parts of a sentence.

Prepositional phrase expressing place at the beginning of the sentence do not need comma.

### Adjective Clauses

Adjective clausess are introduced by **relative pronouns** or **relative adverbs**. Can also be called **adjective connnectors**.

Relative pronouns (or Adjective clause connectors):

- For person: who, whom, whose
- For object/thing: which, that, of which
- that (for people or thing)

Relative adverb: where, when, why

The adjective connnectors can be omitted. This omission is very common in spoken English or in casual written English. It is not as common in formal English.

An adjective clause connector can also be the subject of the clause at the same time.

### Adverb clause

- Adverb time connector: after, before, since, while, as soon as, once, when
- Adverb cause connector: as, now that, because, since
- Condition connector: **if**, in case, provided, providing
- Contrast: although, even though, though
- Manner: as, in that
- Place: where, wherever

Adverb clause connectors (also called subordinating conjunctions) cannot be the subject of the clause.

When the connector comes at the beginning of the sentence, a comma `,` is required in the middle of the sentence.  
Noun clauses & adjective clauses **KHÔNG** dùng comma.

## Verb

Hai loại verbs tạo thành 5 mẫu câu là **Transitive Verbs** (vt, ngoại động từ) và **Intransitive Verbs** (vi, nội động từ).

- Pattern I uses a **Complete Intransitive** which requires no Object nor Complement.
- P. II uses an **Incomplete Intransitive verb** (aka Linking verb) which requires a Subject Complement
- P. III IV V use Transitive Verbs which always require Object.

Different forms of verbs in English, with the example verb `know`:

- Plain form, base form (V1): `know`
- Third-person singular (ngôi thứ ba số ít): `knows`
- Past tense, simple past form (V2): `knew`
- Past participle (V3): `known`. The Past participle form is used in the **perfect tenses**.
- Present participle: `knowing`

It's called "third person"" because the speaker (first person) is talking about a third party (not the speaker or the person being addressed). It's "singular" because it refers to only one person or thing. So, "third person singular" identifies the grammatical subject as a single, separate entity from the speaker and listener, such as "he," "she," "it," or a singular noun like "the boy" or "the dog"

Gerund (danh động từ): **Walking every day** is good for health.

**Infinitie** (động từ nguyên mẫu): _To obey the laws_ is everyone's duty.  
Trong tiếng Nhật cũng có infinitive.

**Participle** (phân từ) is a word formed from a verb, ending in `-ing` (= the **present participle**) or `-ed, -en, etc`. (= the **past participle**).  
Don't be confused with **particle** (tiểu từ).

- A present participle is the `-ing` form of the verb. **The present participle can be (1) part of the verb or (2) an adjective**. It is part of the verb when it is accompanied by some form of the verb `be`. It is an adjective when it is not accompanied by some form of the verb `be`.
- A **Past Participle** often ends in `-ed` but there are also many _irregular past participles_. For many verbs, including `-ed` verbs, the simple past and the past participle are the same and can be easily confused. **The `-ed` form of the verb can be (1) the simple past, (2) the past participle of a verb used in perfect tense, or (3) an adjective**.

_Gerunds and present participles_ both use the `-ing` form of a verb, but they have different grammatical functions. Gerunds act as nouns, while present participles can act as adjectives or part of a verb phrase (continuous tenses).

**Auxiliary verbs** (trợ động từ) help form tenses (e.g., "is running," "have finished"), moods (e.g., "was written," passive voice), and voices of main verbs. Example: `be (am, is, are, was, were), have (has, have, had), do (does, do, did)`.

**Modal verb** (Động từ khuyết thiếu) show if we believe something is certain, possible or impossible: `can-could, may-might, must, shall-should, will-would`  
Phía sau modal verb dùng **base form** of the verb. Ngoại trừ conditional loại 2, 3.  
`always` is an adveb & does not affect verb congjugation

- Everyone `must` give his or her name.
- `May` God bless you.

The modal verb `will` expresses certain future actions, predictions, promises, and offers, while `would` is used for hypothetical situations (Second Conditional), polite requests, past habits, and as the past tense of `will` in reported speech. The key is context: `will` is for real future events, and `would` deals with the unreal, the polite, or the past perspective

> Auxiliary verbs and modal verbs are both types of helping verbs, but they differ in function and characteristics. Modal verbs express modality (possibility, ability, necessity, etc.) and are NOT conjugated, while auxiliary verbs help form tenses, moods, and voices of main verbs and are conjugated.

### Agreement of Subject and Verb

1. **I, we** (ngôi thứ nhất)
2. **you** (ngôi thứ hai)
3. **he, she, it, they** (ngôi thứ ba)

- The pronoun `it` requires a singular verb:

- My friend and my boss **are** here. (Một người bạn và một người xếp đều đang ở đây)
- She and he **are** right.

- When a **prepositional phrase** comes between the subject and the verb, be sure that the verb agrees with the real subject not the object of preposition:

- **A NUMBER OF** always requires a **plural verb**.
  * A number of sheep `are` eating grass. (vài con cừu đang ăn cỏ)
  * A number of people `are` still waiting. (còn vài người đang chờ)

- When **NONE** is the subject, the verb may be singulr or plural according to the noun or pronoun that follows **NONE OF**:
  - None of this `money is` mine.
  - None of `us are` coming.
  - None of the `policemen are` willing to do it.

- When the subject is used with `every, each, either, neither, any`, the verb must be **singular**:
  - **Every student is** willing to join the picnic.
  - `Each` of the passengers `is` reading newspaper.
  - Mr. Brown has two sons and `either` of them **is** intelligent.
  - My parents are in but `neither` of them **is** awake.
  - **Anybody** is fine with me.
  - I don’t mind who — **anyone** is okay.
  - **Everybody** goes to see his show.
  - **Nobody** goes to my birthday party.

- When subjects are connected with `either... or, neither... nor`, the verb agrees with **the subject nearer to it**:
  - Either you `or I am` wrong. (Cả anh lẫn tôi đều sai)
  - Neither the players nor the `referee is` wholly right. (Cả cầu thủ lẫn trọng tài đều không hoàn toàn có lý)
  - Neither the teacher nor his `students are` to blame for the bad result.

- When subject is a plural noun denoting a **sum** of money, a **distance**, a **period** of time, a **measurement** or an **operation**, the verb is **singular**:
  - One thousand dollars `is` too much to py for the used car.
  - Two hundred kilometers `is` such a long way for the refugess to run on foot.
  - More than two hours `is` a long time for me to wait.
  - Thirty six inches `is` one yard.
  - Four times six `is` twenty four.

- Fractions my take **singular or plural** verb depending on the noun that follows:
  - Two-thirds of the dining-**table is** reserved for us.
  - One quarter of the **students are** absent.

- The collective nouns **PEOPLE, POLICE, PUBLIC, CLERGY, CATTLE** are always used with plural verbs:
  - **The public** are requested not to step onn grass.
  - **The police** are searching for the criminal.
  - **People** are happy when news is good.

- A **collective** requires a singular verb when the group is regarded as **one unit**, and a plural verb when members of the group are considered **all members**:
  - My family `is` poor while yours is rich.
  - My family `are` early risers.
  - The football team `is` going to win. (đội bóng sẽ chiến thắng)
  - The football `team` are refreshing themselves. (các cầu thủ đang giải khát)

(all, most, some, half) of the (object) => verb agrees with the object.

- Uncountable nouns like `information` are always treated as singular.
  - The information is interesting.
  - All of the information was interesting.

- (Behind the house) were the bicycles I wanted. => The real subject is bicycles. Subject and verb are inverted in this sentence.
- (Behind the houses) was the bicycle I wanted.

These words or expressions are **gramatically singular**, so they take singular verbs:

- annybody, anyone, anything
- everybody, everyone, everything
- nobody, no one, nothing
- somebody, soneone, something
- each (+ noun), every (+ noun)

- The child **is** playing in the garden.
- The children **are** having a good time.

The verb agreement for `who` depends on its **antecedent** (the noun it refers to); if "who" refers to a singular noun, use a singular verb, and if it refers to a plural noun, use a plural verb. However, "who" as the subject of a question (e.g., `Who is coming?`) uses a singular verb, even if the implied answer is plural.

- `Justin is the person who fixes our computer problems.` => Singular antecedent uses a singular verb.
- `The manager should listen to the people who work for him.` => Plural antecedent

## The 12 Principal Tenses

1. If you see a sentence with one verb in the past annd one verb in the present, the sentence is probably incorrect.
2. However, it is possible for a correct sentence to hve both past and present together.
3. If you see the past and present together, you must check the meaning to determine wwhether or not the sentence is correct.

- `will` means "after the present"; do not use with past tense
- `would` means "after the past"; do not use with present

There are 12 Principal Tenses (4 Forms/Time multiply by 3 Tenses):

1. Simple Present (Thì hiện tại đơn), Simple Past, Simple Future
2. Present Continuous (Thì hiện tại tiếp diễn), Past Continuous, Future continuous
3. Present Perfect (Thì hiện tại hoàn thành), Past Perfect, Future Perfect
4. Present Perfect Continuous (Thì hiện tại hoàn thành tiếp diễn), Past Perfect Continuous, Future Perfect Continuous

The `SIMPLE PAST TENSE` is used to express:

- an action completed in the past:
  - He **learnt** English for five years. (ie. He is not learning it now)
  - He **died** in a collison.
- In Second Conditional. The condition and the result are ==not taking place in the past==, but the past tense is used to indicate the unreal nature of the situation:
  - If I were you, I wouldn't wait to study for the test.

The `SIMPLE FUTURE TENSE` (`will + base verb` because will is a modal verb) is used to express:

- a future possibility or something not depending upon our will:
  - He will (probably) come here tomorrow. (NOT: He will goes)
  - She will like it. (Not: likes)
  - (I think) it will rain soon.
- First Conditional:
  - If he sees me again, he **will take** it back.

---

The `Past Continuous` is used to express:

  - It **was raining** at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
  - I **was staying** in Mocay on your birthday.

---

The `PRESENT PERFECT` is used to express:

- **A past action continuing to the present**
  - He **has learnt** Hanzi for three years. (=He is still learning it now)
  - I **have waited** for you **since** 2 o'clock. (=I'm waiting now)
- The first of two actions in **present or future**:
  - He always does things after he **has asked** for my advice.
  - I'll come here tomorrow when I **have got** some money.
- In the Third Conditional with a modal verb (would, could).

The `PAST PERFECT` is used to express:

- The first of two actions **in the past**
  - When she **had sung** her song, she sat down.
  - Yesterday he told me everything he **had written** in his diary.
  > **JUST** may be used to denote an action recently completed before another.
  - She **had just gone** out when we called on her yesterday.
  - We **had just reached** home when it rained.
- In **Third Conditional** for an impossible supposition in the past. `IF > HAD - past participle + WOULD HAVE-past participle`
  - If you **had passed** your exam last year, you would have gone abroad.
  - I would have helped you if you **had told** me the trouble.

The `FUTURE PERFECT` is used to expres:

  - By next Christmas, I'**ll have lived** here for 15 years.
  - I'm going to see him now and I'**ll have talked** to him for two hours before the conference.

---

> The `Perfect Continuous Tenses` have the same uses as the `Perfect Tenses` but they emphasize the continuous nature of the action.

- The `PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS` is used to express an action going on before the present moment:
  - I **have been waiting** for hours.
  - She **has been living** in Dalat for years.
- The `PAST PERFECT CONTINUOUS` is used to express an action going on before another past action or point:
  - When we **arrived** there yesterday, they **had been showing** the film.
  - She **had been knowing** him (for years) before their wedding in 2002.
- The `FUTURE PERFECT CONTINUOUS` is used to express an action going on before another future action or point:
  - I'**ll have been studying** English for years before I go abroad.
  - He **will have been studying** the case before he makes up his mind.

### Successive & Simultaneous Actions

- For two or more successive actions, every verb in the sentence will pe put in the same tense:
  - Yeterday morning, I **woke** up early, **jumped** out of the bed, **took** a shower, **got** dressed, **had** my breakfast, **looked** for my umbrella, **and went** to the bus-stop.
  - He **came** in and **smiled**.
- For two ore more **simultaneous** actions, only the first verb in the sentence is in finite form, and the rest will be put in **Present Participle**:
  - He **came** in smiling, shking his head, putting his hands in pockets.
  - She **stood** there looking out of the window.
  - My father always **has** his breakfast reading newspaper.

### Conditional

The First Conditional: `If + simple present, will + base verb (simple future tense)`:

- If he sees me again, he **will take** it back.

The Second Conditional: `If + simple past, modal + base verb`. Thường dùng `would/could` as the modal verb.

- If I were you, I wouldn't wait to study for the test.
- If I had a million dollars, I could afford a bigger house.

The Third Conditional: `If + past perfect, modal + present perfect`:

- If it had rained last week, the plants would not have died.
- If I **had finished** college, I would have become a doctor.
- It wasn’t me — I wouldn’t have done this.

## Conjunctions

There are three main types of conjunctions:

1. **Coordinating conjunctions**, often represented by the acronym FANBOYS (`for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so`), connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of **equal grammatical** importance in a sentence.
2. **Subordinating conjunctions**, including `although, because, that, while, after, if, when, whether`, connect a **dependent clause** to the independent clause of a sentence, indicating a specific logical relationship between the two.
3. Correlative Conjunctions: These conjunctions work **in pairs** to connect grammatically equivalent parts of a sentence. Example: `Either/or, neither/nor, both/and`.

You can have either pasta or rice.

**Sentences with two clauses**: When you have two clauses in an English sentence, you must connect the two clauses correctly. One way to connect two clauses is to use `and, but, or, so or yet` (**coordinate connectors**) between the clauses. Có dùng commma.

`and yet but or so for nor`

## Sentences with Reduced Clauses

The two types of clauses that can be reduced in English are:

1. Adjective clauses: only when if the connector is also the subject of the clause
2. adverb clauses.

## Sentences with Inverted Subjects and Verbs

I do not want to go, and neither does Tom. => Two clauses joined with `and`.

If you should arrive before 6:00, just give me a call.  
Should you arrive before 6:00, just give me a call.

## Parallel Structure

- I like to sing and dancing. => not balance
- I like to sing and to dance.

The paired conjunctions `both...and, either...or, neither...nor` and `not only...but also` require prallel structures.

## Problems with usage

- John and Tom are _alike_.
- John and Tom worked in a _like_ manner.

- John is _like_ Tom.
- John is _unlike_ Tom.
- _Like_ Tom, John is tall.
- _Unlike_ Tom, John is tall.

## Chinese

Trong tiếng Trung, tính từ còn được gọi là **hình dung từ**.

Trong ngôn ngữ học, [hư từ](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C6%B0_t%E1%BB%AB) (**funciton words**, chữ Hán: 虛詞, tiếng Anh: function word hay functor) là từ có ít nghĩa từ vựng hoặc có nghĩa từ vựng mơ hồ và là để thể hiện quan hệ ngữ pháp giữa các từ khác trong câu, hoặc là để chỉ rõ thái độ hoặc tâm trạng của người nói. Chúng báo hiệu quan hệ cấu trúc mà từ ngữ có với nhau, và là kết dính để giữ các câu lại với nhau. Do đó chúng làm nên yếu tố quan trọng trong cấu trúc của câu.

[văn ngôn](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%83n_ng%C3%B4n): cổ văn, được sử dụng phổ biển trong sách vở từ thời Xuân Thu thế kỷ 5 TCN cho đến tận thế kỷ 20, khiến nó khác xa với nhiều dạng văn nói tiếng Hán hiện đại. Loại ngôn ngữ viết này dùng ngữ pháp và từ vựng cổ xưa có thể thấy trong điển tịch Tam giáo, nay đã bị đào thải và thay thế bằng bạch thoại ở Trung Quốc sau cuộc vận động văn hóa mới.

Ngày nay người ta dùng [Bạch thoại](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%A1ch_tho%E1%BA%A1i) Quan thoại.

## Sound structure

[Phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology) (âm vị học) is the branch of linguistics that studies how languages systematically organize their phonemes or, for sign languages, their constituent parts of signs. The term can also refer specifically to the sound or sign system of a particular language variety.

A [diphthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong) (**nguyên âm đôi**, from Ancient Greek δίφθογγος (díphthongos) 'two sounds', from δίς (dís) 'twice' and φθόγγος (phthóngos) 'sound'), also known as a gliding vowel or a vowel glide, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable.

Trong tiếng việt, trung, quảng, phụ âm có thể đứng trước.

thanh mẫu = initial = phụ âm phía trước ([consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant))
