## Numbers and Counting

the number system is in units of four instead of three, which can make converting into English quite difficult.

a number such as 10,000,000 is actually split up as 1000,0000. However, thanks to the strong influence of the Western world and the standardization of numbers, when numbers are actually written, the split-off is three digits.
