Q: Tell me what you know about our company.  
I know your company specializes in internet search and web solutions. That's why I want to work there.

Q: How familiar are you with Java, Python, and CSS?  
Yeah, I first started learning those languages back in college.

Q: What's the most challeging project you've worked on during the past few years?  
Well, I am currently working on building a kanban-style work management tool. I try to do everything right from the UI to basic CRUD functionalities, login. I build the entire project from scratch.  
It was a challeging task because the codebase is quite big with lots of different parts. But everything turned out quite well so far.

Q: Why you're leaving?  
Well, the company has grown a lot over the past few years. I learned a lot while there. However, the management has gone through a lot of changes recently, and they were wanting me to give up weekends to work overtime. I came to realize it was having a negative effect on my health, and my family.  
I thought it would be best to look for other opportunities.  
=> I can understand. Yeah, when you don't have your health, or your family suffers, then you have to make a change.

Q: Can you tell me how you heard about this position?  
I saw the job description on TopCV. So I spent some time on your website learning more about the position and the company.

Q: What attracted you to our company?  
What really caught my eye was your focus on growth. I was really impressed with your ambitious goals and the clear plan you have for achieving those goals.

Q: What would you say is your greatest strength?  
My greatest strength is being able to learn new skills quickly and I find that this is very important in this kind of job.

Q: Do you have any question for me?  
Actually, yes. I was wondering what the next step was in the application process.

Well, thank you again for this opportunity. I hope to hear from you soon. Have a great week!
