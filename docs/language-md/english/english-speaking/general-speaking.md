# General speaking

I guess this isn't as quiet a street as I thought it was. And I guess sometimes big trucks do go by.

This trip actually took a lot longer than I expected.

- If you had a chance to try it again, what would you have done differently?
- If I were you, I would study harder.
- If it had been you, what would you have done?

How long has he been there?  
I don't know. It feels like a long time.

Speak up! Can't hear you!

There's porno theatres for that.  
Yeah I know I tried that.

- A man opens a door for you, or helps you onto a bus, and you respond, “Thank you, sir”.
- You open a door for a man, and say, “After you, sir”.
- Someone, male or female, bumps into a man accidentally, and says, “Sorry, sir”.
- Sorry sir I didn't mean that.
- After you, Madam. = Nhường bà đi trước.

Figure I'm gonna do that, I might as well get paid for it.

Well I, I just wanna work long hours.

I'm working long hours now. 6 in the afternoon to 6 in the morning, sometimes even 8 in the morning. 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days a week.

It's a long hustle but it keeps me real busy.

I don't care. Don't make no difference to me. It does to some. Some won't even take spooks.

Look you can tell me what your name is. I'm not gonna do anything.

12 hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn.  
The days go on and on and they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of some place to go.

She appeared like an angel out of this filthy mass.

Let's not fight.

Look we'll make it real simple. We don't pay for the buttons.

I didn't forget.

That taxi drivers been staring at us.

## Negotiate

No big deal!

This is the way that this works.

I think that you should let me know what you know and then we'll try and work something out.

I enjoy all faiths. I don't belong to one religion in particular. I like them all. I like everything.

Just 'cause there's something on the ground doesn't mean there's anything beneath it.

Your family name is Pham, yes?  
That's right.  
How many's in your family?  
My father and mother and my younger sister.

I don't know. My uncle always said there was oil there, but I don't know what they heard or what they think.

Thank you so much for your hospitality, Mr. Sunday.

If we could take a few minutes, there's something I'd very much like to talk with you about.

Well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.  
I believe that's called seepage. Doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath.

Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

What about this?

I can't help thinking (= my true feeling is that) she'd be better off without him.  
I didn't want to hurt her but I couldn't help it.

I'll guide you. (để tao dẫn đường cho)

That's very nice. Thank you.

What are those men doing?  
They're just guys that are working for us.  
They're just looking around.

He said he'd like to speak with whoever is doing the buying.

We're going to dig water wells here, and water wells means irrigation. Irrigation means cultivation. We're going to raise crops here where before it just simply wasn't possible.

I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Yes?

Thank you so much for your time, and good night.

Anything the church can do for you?
I don't believe so. No. Thank you.

I understand you've asked the people to gather around and watch the well begin tomorrow. Is that right?

They are not necessarily the same thing.

What time? - What time's good for you, Eli?  
4:00. - Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

Won't be a minute. Fast as you can, H.W.

If you want to argue, go elsewhere, please.

There aren't going to be any finals, Dux, at least not for you.

I have to go and deal with this now. You wait here for me.  
I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

Just have to go and have a word with the conductor.
I'll be right back. You stay here. You understand? You stay here. I'll be right back.

Get me a hammer!  
Here you go.

That's enough now.  
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.  
Do you hear me?

Now, call... God damn it, what's his name?  
I'll do it right away.

When do we get our money, Daniel?

Can't you do that? (loud, angry)  
If you had let me bless the well, this wouldn't have happened.

You are a stupid man, Abel.

I followed His word, Eli. I tried.

You didn't do anything but sit down. You're lazy, and you're stupid.
Do you think God is going to save you for being stupid?
He doesn't save stupid people, Abel.
I will tear you apart for what you've done, you stupid man!

Shut your mouth, Abel! It was your stupid son!
It was Paul who told him to come here. I know it.
He went to him and he said, "My stupid, weak father will give away his lots.
"Go and take him." And you let it happen.

Get out of there!

I came to find you.

If you're looking for the bandits' hideout, I know where it is!

I worked on a chain gang for six months building roads.

Believe it or not, for all the terrible things I've gotten myself into, when they picked me up, I hadn't done anything. But I've done my share of things that shouldn't be talked about.

I'd like to be here. I'm a good worker. I worked cable tool rigs, built railroads. I won't need any favors.

I know you didn't get on with our father.

Are you an angry man, Henry?
About what?
Are you envious? Do you get envious?
I don't think so, no.
I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people.
That part of me is gone. Working and not succeeding, all my failures have left me… I just don't care.
Well, if it's in me, it's in you. There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I want to earn enough money. I can get away from everyone.

I worked for Geological Survey and went to Kansas. I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't. I don't like to explain myself.

I don't want to talk about those things.

I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
Having you here gives me a second breath of life. I can't keep doing this on my own with these people.

How's your boy? - Thank you for asking.
Is there anything we can do?

You have 11,000 acres in Little Boston. You have one proven well
You haven't been paying attention. That's three proven wells.

One night I'm going to come to you, inside of your house, or wherever you're sleeping, and I'm going to cut your throat.
What? What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy? Did you hear what I said?
I heard what you said.
why did you say it?
You don't tell me about my son.
Why are you acting insane and threatening to cut my throat?
You don't tell me about my son.
I'm not telling you anything!
I'm asking you to be reasonable. If I've offended you, I apologize.
You'll see what I can do.

He was the holdout. When we were doing the buying. He had hoped to speak with you.

All right. Pack it up, Henry.

Is he here? - No, he's out.

Tell him I'd like to speak with him. Not about drilling.
And I'll be back in a week.

There's that house in Fond du Lac that John Hollister built. Do you remember it?
I thought as a boy that was the most beautiful house I'd ever seen, and I wanted it.
I wanted to live in it.
And eat in it.
And clean it.
And even as a boy, I wanted to have children to run around in it.

**Do you ever miss being in high school?**
I do actually because I started working very early. I did not get to experience the university or college. So the memories that I have or the friends I have is from high school and I do think about times where we could just go back and have a reunion and like have that moment again.

**Do you have any animals in your home as pets?**
Yes, I have two dogs. They're both from the shelter, the animal shelter, they're rescues. I've always had pets. My family really likes keeping animals around.

**What's your favorite season of the year?**
Well, I love anytime when the sun starts to come out. So around spring or early summer before it gets too hot, you know, I just love a little bit of vitamin D, and it makes me happier as well. So that is definitely better than the winter.

**What do you do when it gets too hot in the summer?**
I tend to go into any kind of buildings with air conditioning, and I have the fan on every night when it's really hot. So, yeah, when it gets really hot in the summer, I really need a lot of fans and kind of just anything I can hold with me when I go out as well.

**Where do you live?**
Oh, I've just moved to London. I've actually and just move to an area called Wansworth. It's really nice. It's close to the river.

**Talk about the time you met a new friend:**
The first time I met a new friend, so I'm gonna go way back, it was my first day of school, kindergarten, and I met a girl named Amanpreet Kaur. I think we just turned four years old. We met obviously in kindergarten, first day of school. What I like about her when I first saw her, I mean we were sitting together where the teacher made us sit next to each other. She had this long hair, and it was sectioned into two parts and it was just braided all the way down. And she had the cutest face I've ever seen. She had this little fluffy, marshmallow-like face. I guess that's all it takes when you're a kid to want to be friends with somebody. And then I tried to, so there's like this little thing that kids do where they put their thumb out to show other kids that "I want to be your friend." Then if you don't want to be friends with them, you do this. It's a silly little thing. So I did this to her. It put my thumb out to say, Hey, do you want to be friends? and she was like, this. I was heartbroken. I was like, How can she not want to be my friend? And then I saw her again the next day and the next day after that, and the day after that. And then eventually we ended up becoming best friends. She did it back to me, obviously, at some point. She was my first best friend that I ever had in life. She was from Punjab, which is a part of India. Her mom used to make the most amazing… It's called paratha. It's like this stuffed bread. It's like they put potato and spices into a flatbread. And my mom used to make something called sheera, which is this sweet, semilina situation.

**Is it easy to predict the weather in your country?**
I suppose it is, yeah, because like I said earlier, some parts of India, the temperature doesn't go over a certain degrees, but wherein some parts are really hot and humid throughout the year. I think it's quite easy to predict, but when it comes to rain or monsoon season, it's very hard. Like this year, a few months ago in the north of India, it was raining heavily and the rain did not stop for, I'd say, two weeks. So that was not predictable.

**Why do you think some people fail in some careers?**
I think one of the main drivers for people is money. And when you do anything solely because of money, then it will never work. And the reason people fail I think, the biggest reason is because they have failed to align their identity with their work, because we spend a third of our lives in work. So a very big proportion of it needs to feel fulfilled. And it can only be fulfilled if you understand what you like authentically inside and then go into a career. But then the reality is that most ppl then jump in and figure it out, explore, and then we'll work it out, you know, in hindsight, but I guess that's what life's about.

Ran!! Keep an eye on him.

Today was the best day ever!
Hah… Speak for yourself. [explain](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/speak-for-yourself)

There still hasn't been any progress.

That is not correct either.

I gotta be careful with these things.

After two hours of coding, it was time to have dinner.

Hey don't worry about it.

You haven't forgotten about us, have you boy?

Easy up, man. Damn.

Watch your head!

Get outta here, you fucking bastard!

How have you been, Carl? How's your wonderful family?
I'm here to bury my mom. You know that.
Yeah, I guess I do.

What've we got here?

I heard you can get killed at that kumite.
Only if you fuck up.

Tomorrow we leave for the kumite.

Sir. Excuse me, but colonel Cooke would like to see you before you leave on furlough.
What's the problem?
The colonel found out you're going to Hong Kong. He wants to talk to you about it.
Tell him I'll be right there after I take a shower.

What's taking so long, captain?

Where's Dux? - He was at the gym, like you said. He took a shower, I waited, and he disappeared.
What do you mean, he disappeared?
One minute he was there, next he wasn't.
Jesus Christ! If anything happens to Dux in Hong Kong… Get Helmer and Rawlins on this right away. And I don't wanna see your face again until Dux is beside it. Understand?

How is he? - He's resting now. He'll be so happy to see you.
It's so good to be here again. - I'll tell him you are here.

Shingo and I were close friends, like brothers.

What will happen now? - No more training. I stop now.
But you have so much to teach.

I left Japan because of the war.

I'm going to Hong Kong. - You sure you want to do this?
To honor you means everything to me.

This your first time in Hong Kong?
You two are here for the kumite, aren't you?

I also happen to know a little bit about some of your competition.

Would you just tell me how you got invited?

If you want to see some real fighting, you can see me fight at the kumite.
I'm here, too, for the kumite.
Aren't you a little young for full contact?

Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.
I'm Frank Dux.

Mrs. Tanaka, it's very important to the government of the United States that we find Frank Dux.
We understand that he might have visited Mr. Tanaka here recently.
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.
We're sorry to hear that.
Was Frank here recently?
Frank came here to pay his respects.
When was that?
Two days ago.
Did he say or do you know if he was going to Hong Kong?
l don't know.
Of course you know. Look, we're not trying to–
Mrs. Tanaka, we're very sorry to have disturbed you.
Thank you very much for your time.

Here's a picture of the man that we're looking for. His name is Frank Dux.  
We have reason to believe Frank is here in Hong Kong.  
His name was on a list on a flight from San Francisco two days ago.  
Two days ago? Maybe he already left, went somewhere else.

lnspector Chen.  
We all know that the kumite is happening here in Hong Kong.  
And we all know it's going on over the next three days.

Look, all we want you to do is pass this picture out to your men.
They spot Dux, they give us a call at our hotel. Simple.

Guess the kumite starts one day earlier this year.

Look, guys, let's all just calm down, okay?
No.
She is coming with me upstairs.

lf l can grab it before you close your hand, I get the girl. lf l cannot she's yours.

Oh, jeez, Frankie, l hope you know what you're doing.

Looks like she's mine. Now leave the lady alone.

l've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal like a cockfight, except it's with people.
You have the wrong picture.

Okay, l'll talk to you, but one condition.
What's that?
You agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night.

That hurts me just looking at it.

Let's make our own monster movie. A really scary one.

What sort of monster might that be Tigger?
I'm not telling. It'll ruin the surprise.

Although it's not quite as important as the hero. It's still very important.
Really? Oh what is it Pooh?

I would never do it again. ???

How's your eel, as good as mine?
I don't know, I haven't tasted it yet.

Inspector Chen. What a pleasant surprise. Please join us.

We're taking you back, Frank. Let's go. - Only when the kumite is over.
Who the hell are these two scumbags?
Just stay out of it, pal. lt's not your business, okay? - [l ain't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHe5ixXZQIw) your pal, dickface.

Look, Frank the government has invested a lot of time and money in you.
Uncle Sam can't afford to let you get hurt.
l won't get hurt.
That's why we're here, to make sure of that.
Don't make it tough on us, Frank.

Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you, Frank.

You guys are driving me crazy.

As you can see to the left, we got some flowers.

If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.

Night is falling.
It does that every day about this time.

[to say the least](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/to-say-the-least)

Don't try to stop me.
We're not. He will.

l did not come this far to stop now.
You shouldn't have come in the first place.

Robin's future looked very, very bright, but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer, a very tough kind of cancer.

Robin tells me he has quit smoking, though, and he no longer thinks that cigarettes are cool.

Few people on this planet know what it is to be truly despised.
Can you blame them?
I earn a living fronting an organization that kills 1,200 human beings a day.
1,200 people. We're talking two jumbojet plane loads of men, women and children.
I mean, there's Attila, Genghis, and me, Nick Naylor, the face of cigarettes...the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.

This is where I work, the Academy of Tobacco Studies.
It was established by seven gentlemen you may recognize from C-SPAN.
These guys realized quick if they were going to claim that cigarettes were not addictive, they better have proof.

They found him in Germany. I won't go into the details.
He's been testing the link between nicotine
and lung cancer for 30 years and hasn't found any conclusive results.
The man's a genius. He could disprove gravity.

It's just like a John Grisham novel-you know, without all the espionage.

Most importantly, we've got spin control.
That's where I come in. I get paid to talk. I don't have an MD or law degree.

I have a bachelor's in kicking ass and taking names. You know that guy
who can pick up any girl? I'm him on crack.

Joan, how on earth would Big Tobacco profit off of the loss of this young man?
Now, I hate to think in such callous terms, but, if anything, we'd be losing a customer.
It's not only our hope, it's in our best interest to keep Robin alive and smoking.

The Ron Goodes of this world...want the Robin Willigers to die.
What?
You know why? So that their budgets will go up.
This is nothing less than trafficking in human misery, and you, sir, ought to be ashamed of yourself.

As a matter of fact, we're about to launch... a $50 million campaign aimed at persuading kids not to smoke.
Because I think that we can all agree that there is nothing more important than America's children.

$50 million?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!

How about lobbyists?
What's that?
It's kind of like being a movie star. It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

My mom used to smoke. She says that cigarettes kill.
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?
No.
A scientific researcher of some kind?
No.
Well, she doesn't exactly sound like a credible expert, now, does she?
Don't feel bad. It's okay to listen to your mom.

I mean, it's good to listen to your parents... Joey.
All I'm suggesting is that there will always be people trying to tell you what to do and what to think.

I'm here to say that when someone tries to act like some sort of an expert, you can respond, "Who says?"

That's not what I'm getting at.\
My point is that you have to think for yourself. You have to challenge authority.\
If your parents told you that chocolate was dangerous, would you just take their word for it? - No.\
Exactly.

So perhaps instead of acting like sheep when it comes to cigarettes, you should find out for yourself.

After watching the footage
of the Kent State shootings, BobbyJay, then 17, signed up
for the National Guard so he, too, could shoot
college students.
But the National Guard
recruiter was out to lunch, so BobbyJay ended up
shooting Panamanians instead, which was almost as good
as college students. Only they shoot back.

Your family name is Sunday, yes?
That's right.
How many's in your family?
My father and mother and sisters and my brother Eli.

I don't know. My uncle always said there was oil there, but I don't know what they heard or what they think.

Good evening.

My name's Daniel Plainview. This is my son, H.W.

Thank you so much for your hospitality, Mr. Sunday.

If we could take a few minutes, there's something I'd very much like to talk with you about.

Well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.

I believe that's called seepage. Doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath.

Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

I understand you've asked the people to gather around and watch the well begin tomorrow. Is that right?

They are not necessarily the same thing.

What time's good for you, Eli?
4:00.
Well, let's make it 4:00 then.

Won't be a minute.
Fast as you can, H.W.

I'll be back in a minute.

I have to go and deal with this now. You wait here for me.

I'll be back. I'll be back in a minute.

Get me a STH | Get me a hammer!
Here you go.

That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W. That's enough.

Do you hear me?

Now, call... God damn it, what's his name?
I'll do it right away.

When do we get our money, Daniel?

Can't you do that? (loud, angry)
If you had let me bless the well, this wouldn't have happened.

## Staying healthy, advice

You should **see about** getting your hair cut.

## Others topics

Dad, why is the American government the best government?  
Because of our endless appeals system.  
Joe, you're not writing down what I just said are you? Mm-hmm.  
Joey, stop for a second. What is the subject of your essay?  
Why is American government the best government in the world.  
Your teacher crafted that question?  
Yeah. Why?  
Well... I'll look past the obvious problems in syntax for a moment, and I'll focus more on the core of the question.  
I mean, "A," does America have the best government in the world?  
And "B," what constitutes a "best government"?  
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?  
Hmm?  
And America- definitely not best.  
Perhaps not even better than most.  
We do have a very entertaining government...  
Dad.  
I'm sorry.

Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?  
Bullshit.  
Yes, exactly.  
B.S., if I may, is what questions like the one your teacher posed are made for. Because even if America had the best government, there'd be no way to prove it.

Q: How long have you been studying English?  
Well, all students here start learning English from elementary school. But unfortunately the teaching from school did more harm than good to me. I think I only started learning English efficiently at eighteen.

Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

Yesterday, I bought Katie a flower and she gave me a kiss on the cheek

## Talk about Yourself

I grew up in a small town.

If I was to move to this town, I wouldn't want to live on a busy street. I wouldn't want to live on a street where there's lots of trucks and loud cars and noises.

I would If I could.

I'm going to get fluent in Japanese. It's been 8 years now that I've lived in Vietnam. I know I should be fluent. It's not an easy language to learn.  
My pronunciation, I think, is very good given the fact that Vietnamese is not my native language

Do you ever miss being in high school?

## Injuries, health Care, medicine

If you do something crazy like go mountain biking and you go fast down a hill, you're going to get injured.

When I played soccer the other day, I hurt myself.

You can either, have someone take you to the hospital, or you can call an ambulance.
