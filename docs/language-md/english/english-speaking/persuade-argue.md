Now, you have a great chance here, but bear in mind you could lose it all if you're not careful.

What is your offer? We're wasting time.

Mr. Bankside, I'm not going to waste your time. I'd certainly appreciate it if you didn't waste mine.

What kind of royalty are you talking about?
One-sixth, plus a guarantee to start drilling within 10 days.

If I travel all the way out there and I find that you've been lying to me, I'm going to find you and I'm going to take more than my money back. Is that all right with you?
Yes, sir.
All right, then.
