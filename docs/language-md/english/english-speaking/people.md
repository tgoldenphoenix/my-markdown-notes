**ông út**

I'm going to talk about Mr. "út". He is a man who works for my family before I was even born. So, we've known each other for a very long time. I believe he was in his 30s when I was a kid. We run a family business selling building materials. He drives a motorized freight tricycle. He is the most diligent worker I've ever known.
