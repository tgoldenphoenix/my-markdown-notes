## Talk about your journey

About exactly a year ago, I was going to Phan Rang for tết holiday.

I didn't really get any sleep last night.

Two weeks ago, I went to Vung Tau with my mother's office. The traffic was super bad. We were stuck in a heavy traffic jam in Saigon. That prolongs our estimated time to go to Vung Tau by 4 hours. What is even worse is that we were stuck on the expressway so there is nowhere we could stop and urinate.

At last, we arrived at our destination. My back got so sore after 8 hours lying uncomfortably in the sleeper bus. The initial plan was to go swimming in the beach after arriving in Vung Tau the afternoon around 5 p.m. But when we got there, it was already dark and we could only walk on the shore. So after walking along the beach for 30 minutes, we had our dinner and went to sleep. The dinner was not bad though.

## Traffic & Vehicle

A quiet street is a street where there is very little traffic or no traffic.

Over here, there's actually a sign that says no trucks.

I guess if you're running a business, you probably want to be on busy streets so you have lots of customers.

Young men like to do wheelie on the road.

Just one parking bus might block half of the road. It's really annoying.

A **mini transit bus** will take you to a **sleeper bus**.

I'll show you what the bus looks like.

These **double-decker** buses will take you on a tour around District 1.

You can catch a **shuttle bus** to go to work.

A sleeper bus is a type of specially adapted **coach bus** with sleeping facilities for passengers.

The driver honked the horn to warn the pedestrian.

Two transportable compartment barges (xà lan) provide a working platform for heavy construction equipments. One barge supports the **boom lift** (xe nâng cầng) work platform. The other one supports a crawler based crane.
