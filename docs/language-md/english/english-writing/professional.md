## Describe yourself

I studied at the CTUMP until the early of 2022, when it was temporarily shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was fun, but now I’m looking to move into web design, and am currently working on an associate’s degree in that subject at Seattle Central College. You can find my professional website over at <RTVGilder.com>.

After graduating, I got a job at a technical consulting company down in Auburn, called Praece Consulting. I’ve been enjoying this job a lot, and I still can’t really believe that my plan to go back to school and start a new career actually worked. But, it really did.
