## Friendly

Dear Mr Unwin,

I have been ill and am still rather weak, and have had others of the common human troubles, so that time has slipped out of my hands: I have accomplished next to nothing of any kind since I saw you.

My chief joy comes from learning that the Silmarillion is not rejected with scorn.

May I wish you bon voyage - and a safe return. I shall look forward to seeing you again.

## Email to a professor

Dear Professor Smith,

My name is Pham An Hao and I am a sophomore in your Tuesday/Thursday General Physics Class. I am writing because in class yesterday you mentioned having some open positions in your research lab.

## Cover letter

Dear Ms. Johnson,

My name is Pham An Hao and I am a Web Developer. I am writing to express my interest in the intership program with your company. I saw the job description on a recruitment channel (TopCV).

Previously, I held an internship at another local advertising agency, working on critical projects for their clients. During that intership, I had the  
opportunity to learn the Git workflow in a professional team. I also learned how to communicate with my colleagues on technical problems  
I believe that my knowledge of software engineering could be of interest to you, as I read that you are looking to grow your company.

I feel that your agency places prominence in similar areas and having the opportunity of serving as an intern with you will give me the exposure I need to advance my career while using what I've already learned to make an impact on your clients.

Thank your for your consideration.

Sincerely,
An Hao
