# Writing tips

Take notes of phares, vocab, grammar (i call them input) that you know you'll be using again. Put them in a place where you can query easily (a glossary). You get real input from video, book, and store in the glossary to use later.

You can write in many formats: journaling, essay, describe something, narrative. These writing format you can get inspiration online.

It might helps to choose one big topic for the whole week. Then you spend the whole week master that topic. Each topic sẽ có 1 sub-section in the glossary for related vocab, grammar. You will spend 45 minutes EVERYDAY of the week to practice writing. 15 mins planning, 30 minutes writing (you can look for input from the glossary went writing).

Get some input, do some reasearch, read something about the topic before sitting down and write about it. Input first!

Don't use input that you have never seen before in your writing. Use the 45 minutes of practice to use your input, not to learn new input.

You can writing the same thing everyday for the whole week with some changes here and there. It's ok to take your time and master what you are writing.

If you don't know what to write about, just find something correct and copy it.
