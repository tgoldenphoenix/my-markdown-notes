# Blog Writing

## About This Blog

I started this blog as a place to host writing I was doing for fun, on various topics, and also my learning experiences.

The majority of content on here is that Linux stuff, but there are a few philosophical posts and video game reviews thrown in as well. You can browse the categories using the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page, though they’re a bit messy.

I don’t really post on a consistent schedule, but I try to put up one or two things a week. When I’m in school, that tends to disrupt things. I apologize in advance for any unplanned breaks.

In late 2018, I started a project (back on tumblr, actually) to write up a blog post for every single chapter of Moby-Dick; or, the Whale, which is one of my favorite books. I've read it several times already, so I thought it would be fun to go through and really examine it more closely.

The posts focus on different things as I go. Chasing down stray biblical and cultural references from the 1840s, examining specific moments in depth, piecing together broad themes. Early on, I got caught up a lot in summarizing the chapters, but I've been focusing more on reacting to it lately.
