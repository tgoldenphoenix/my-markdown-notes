# Woodworking, Metalworking and Crafting

A [scarf joint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarf_joint), or scarph joint, is a method of joining two members end to end in woodworking or metalworking. The scarf joint is used when the material being joined is not available in the length required.

## Metalworking

Sharpening stones, or whetstones (đá mài), are used to sharpen the edges of steel tools such as knives through grinding and honing.

[cog](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cog?q=cog): one of a series of teeth on the edge of a wheel that fit between the teeth on the next wheel and cause it to move

A [cogged circle](http://www.powermobydick.com/Moby037.html) refers to a wheel or disc with teeth or cogs around its edge, also known as a cogwheel or gear.

Honing is an abrasive machining process that produces a precision surface on a metal workpiece by scrubbing an abrasive grinding stone or grinding wheel against it along a controlled path. Honing is primarily used to improve the geometric form of a surface, but can also improve the surface finish.

Welding (hàn) is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, primarily by using high temperature to melt the parts together and allow them to cool, causing fusion.

## Carpentry

A Speed Square, also generically called a rafter square, rafter angle square, and triangle square, is a multi-purpose triangular carpenters' tool used for marking out. Its functions encompass many of those offered by combination squares, try squares, and framing squares. Carpenters use it to make basic measurements and mark lines on dimensional lumber, and as a saw guide for short 45 and 90 degree cuts.

Caulk (also known as caulking and calking, keo trám silicon) is a material used to seal joints or seams against leakage in various structures and piping.

A **vise or vice** (British English) is a mechanical apparatus used to secure an object to allow work to be performed on it.

A hand [plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(tool)) (đồ bào) is a tool for shaping wood using muscle power to force the cutting blade over the wood surface. Some rotary power planers are motorized power tools used for the same types of larger tasks, but are unsuitable for fine-scale planing, where a miniature hand plane is used.\

## Fastener

A bolt or Bu lông (bắt nguồn từ từ tiếng Pháp boulon) or con ốc is an externally helical threaded fastener capable of being tightened or released by a twisting force (torque) to a matching nut. The bolt has an external male thread requiring a matching nut with a pre-formed female thread.

A nut, đai ốc, còn gọi là con tán hoặc ê-cu ("ê-cu" bắt nguồn từ tiếng Pháp écrou) is a type of fastener with a threaded hole. Nuts are almost always used in conjunction with a mating bolt to fasten multiple parts together.

A screw, con vít, ốc vít, đinh vít hay đinh ốc (vít xuất phát từ tiếng Pháp là vis) is an externally helical threaded fastener capable of being tightened or released by a twisting force (torque) to the head.

A nail (cây đinh) is a small object made of metal (or wood, called a tree nail or "trunnel") which is used as a fastener, as a peg to hang something, or sometimes as a decoration.
