## Textile industry terms

A [loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom) (khung cửi) is a device used to weave cloth and tapestry. The basic purpose of any loom is to hold the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads.

A [cotton gin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin)—meaning "cotton engine"—is a machine that quickly and easily separates cotton fibers from their seeds, enabling much greater productivity than manual cotton separation. The separated seeds may be used to grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil.

In the textile industry, a [tow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tow_(fibre)) (or hards) is a coarse, broken fibre, removed during processing flax, hemp, or jute and separated from the shives. Flax tows are often used as upholstery stuffing and oakum.

Filling or woof: the crosswide threads in loomed material.  
Warp: the lengthwise threads in loomed material

[Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_(weaving)) : an object that carries the woof thread back and forth through the warp threads
