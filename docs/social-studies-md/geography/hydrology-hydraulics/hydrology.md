# Hydrology & Hydraulics

[Hydrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology) (thủy văn học, from Ancient Greek ὕδωρ (húdōr) 'water' and -λογία (-logía) 'study of') is the scientific study of the movement, distribution, and management of water on Earth and other planets, including the water cycle, water resources, and drainage basin sustainability.

[Hydraulics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics) (thủy lực học, from Ancient Greek ὕδωρ (húdōr) 'water' and αὐλός (aulós) 'pipe') is a technology and applied science using engineering, chemistry, and other sciences involving the mechanical properties and use of liquids.

## Terminologies

A [drainage basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin) (lưu vực) is an area of land where all flowing surface water converges to a single point, such as a river mouth, or flows into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean.

A [tributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tributary) (phụ lưu), or an affluent, is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream (main stem or "parent"), river, or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean.

A [distributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributary) (phân lưu, chi lưu), or a distributary channel is a stream channel that branches off and flows away from a main stream channel. It is the opposite of a tributary, a stream that flows towards and into another stream or river. 

A [drainage divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_divide) (Đường phân thủy), water divide, ridgeline, watershed, water parting or height of land is elevated terrain that separates neighboring drainage basins.

In meteorology, [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation) (**giáng thủy**) is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls from clouds due to gravitational pull.

A [river mouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_mouth) (**cửa sông**) is where a river flows into a larger body of water, such as another river, a lake/reservoir, a bay/gulf, a sea, or an ocean.

A [river delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta) (châu thổ) is a landform shaped like a triangle, created by the deposition of sediment that is carried by a river and enters slower-moving or stagnant water. This occurs at a river mouth, when it enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment.\

A [meander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meander) (đoạn uốn khúc) is one of a series of regular sinuous curves in the channel of a river or other watercourse. It is produced as a watercourse erodes the sediments of an outer, concave bank (cut bank or river cliff) and deposits sediments on an inner, convex bank which is typically a point bar.
