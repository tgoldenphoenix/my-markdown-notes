![rhythm01-left-note-right-chord.png](./assets/rhythm01-left-note-right-chord.png)

You DON’T use the pedal with this rhythm.

LOTS of songs use this exact rhythm and chord sequence - it is actually known as the ‘**1950s Chord Progression’**. C Am F G

Play the sequence and see if you can SING-ALONG with any of the following songs - you may have to change the speed you play for each song.
