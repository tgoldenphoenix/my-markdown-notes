The traditional date for the feast is January 6. However since 1970 the celebration has been held in some countries on the first Sunday after January 1.

The [baptism of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Jesus), the ritual purification of Jesus with water by John the Baptist, was a major event described in the three synoptic Gospels of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark and Luke). It is considered to have taken place at Al-Maghtas (also called Bethany Beyond the Jordan), today located in Jordan.\
Trong Kitô giáo Đông phương, **lễ Chúa Giêsu chịu phép rửa** được cử hành vào ngày 6 tháng 1 (ngày theo lịch Julian, tương ứng với ngày 19 tháng 1 theo lịch Gregory). Trong Giáo hội Công giáo Rôma, Khối hiệp thông Anh giáo, các Giáo hội Luther và một số giáo phái phương Tây khác, lễ này thường được cử hành vào Chủ nhật ngay sau Lễ Hiển Linh.

It is the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, preceded by Lent (or Great Lent), a 40-day period of fasting, prayer, and penance.\
Thường diễn ra vào tháng 3 hoặc tháng 4 mỗi năm. Phục Sinh cũng được dùng để chỉ một mùa trong năm phụng vụ Công giáo gọi là Mùa Phục Sinh, kéo dài đúng 50 ngày, từ Chúa Nhật Phục Sinh đến Lễ Hiện Xuống.

[Pentecost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost): Lễ Chúa Thánh Thần Hiện Xuống

[Tuần bát nhật](https://legiomariaevn.com/chi-tiet-tin-tuc/2309/tuan-bat-nhat-phuc-sinh-la-gi-.html) (Octave) là thời gian tám ngày mừng lễ hay kính nhớ mầu nhiệm nào đó. Hiện nay, trong lịch phụng vụ của Giáo hội chỉ còn ghi hai Bát Nhật là Bát Nhật Phục Sinh và Bát Nhật Giáng Sinh. Hai Bát Nhật mà Giáo hội mừng kính cũng kết thúc bằng hai lễ long trọng:\
**Bát Nhật của Giáng Sinh** kết thúc vào ngày 1 tháng 1, lễ trọng kính Đức Ma-ri-a Mẹ Thiên Chúa;\
**Bát Nhật Phục Sinh** kết thúc vào ngày lễ Chúa Nhật Áo Trắng. Bát Nhật Phục Sinh mà truyền thống Ro-ma quen gọi là Tuần lễ Áo Trắng, ra đời từ thế kỷ IV vì lúc đó Giáo hội quan tâm làm sao để các tân tòng có một huấn giáo hậu phép rửa về các mầu nhiệm mà họ đã lãnh nhận. Tuy nhiên, huấn giáo này cũng dành cho toàn thể dân chúng nữa.

Vậy, có thể hiểu rằng Tuần Bát Nhật là những ngày kéo dài lễ hội

It is celebrated by many churches 40 days after Christmas on Candlemas, or the "Feast of the Presentation of Jesus".
