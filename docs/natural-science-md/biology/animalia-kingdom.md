## Euungulata glade (móng guốc)

**Ungulates** (nhánh thú móng guốc) are members of the diverse clade **Euungulata** ("true ungulates"), which primarily consists of large mammals with hooves.  
Latin: unguis (nail)

**Bovines** (subfamily Bovinae, phân họ trâu bò) comprise a diverse group of 10 genera of medium to large-sized ungulates, including cattle, bison, African buffalo, water buffalos, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes.  
A **bison** (pl.: bison, bò rừng bison) is a large bovine in the genus Bison (Greek: "wild ox" (bison)) within the tribe Bovini. Two extant and numerous extinct species are recognised.

### Artiodactyla Order

**Artiodactyls** are placental mammals belonging to the order **Artiodactyla** (Bộ Guốc chẵn, bộ Móng chẵn, from Ancient Greek ἄρτιος, ártios 'even' and δάκτυλος, dáktylos 'finger, toe'). Typically, they are _ungulates_ which bear weight equally on two (an even number) of their five toes (the third and fourth, often in the form of a hoof). The other three toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or pointing posteriorly.

**Hippopotamidae** (Họ Hà mã) is a family of stout, naked-skinned, and semiaquatic artiodactyl mammals, possessing three-chambered stomachs and walking on four toes on each foot. While they resemble pigs physiologically, their closest living relatives are the cetaceans (the whale). They are formally referred to as hippopotamids.

The **hippopotamus** (hà mã, river horse, Hippopotamus amphibius) (pl.: hippopotamuses; also shortened to hippo (pl.: hippos) is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa.  
Its name comes from the Ancient Greek for "river horse".

The wasps do not constitute a clade, a complete natural group with a single ancestor, as bees and ants are deeply nested within the wasps, having evolved from wasp ancestors.

#### Diptera Order

**Flies** are insects of the **order Diptera** (bộ ruồi), the name being derived from the Greek δι- di- "two", and πτερόν pteron "wing". Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics.

## Chordata Phylum (ngành dây sống)

A **chordate** is a deuterostomic bilaterial animal belonging to the phylum **Chordata** (**Ngành động vật có dây sống**).

Cetologists, or those who practice cetology, seek to understand and explain cetacean evolution, distribution, morphology, behavior, community dynamics, and other topics.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE

The [sperm whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_whale) (**cá nhà táng**) or **cachalot** (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. He being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.\
Sperm whaling was a major industry in the 19th century, depicted in the novel Moby-Dick. Nguồn gốc tên gọi sperm whale là do dầu cá nhà táng ([spermaceti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermaceti)) từng bị tưởng nhầm là tinh dịch của cá voi.

The [bowhead whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowhead_whale) (Cá voi đầu cong, cá voi Bắc cực, cá voi Greenland hay cá voi Nga, Balaena mysticetus), sometimes called the Greenland right whale, Arctic whale, and polar whale, is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family Balaenidae and is the only living representative of the genus Balaena. It is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters, and is named after its characteristic massive triangular skull, which it uses to break through Arctic ice.

The [humpback whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale) (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale. The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and tubercles on its head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song that typically lasts from 4 to 33 minutes.

The **fin whale** (cá voi lưng xám, Balaenoptera physalus), also known as the **finback whale** or common rorqual, is a species of baleen whale and the second-longest cetacean after the blue whale.

The [blue whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale) (**cá voi xanh, cá ông**, Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 m (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 t (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the _largest animal_ known ever to have existed. Đây là loài động vật được tôn thờ ở _Việt Nam_. The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue on its upper surface and somewhat lighter underneath.\
Blue whales were referred to as "Sibbald's rorqual", after Robert Sibbald, who first described the species. Whalers sometimes referred to them as **sulphur bottom** whales, as the bellies of some individuals are tinged with yellow.[11] This tinge is due to a coating of huge numbers of diatoms. (Herman Melville briefly refers to "sulphur bottom" whales in his novel Moby-Dick.)

**II. the OCTAVO WHALE:** These embrace the whales of middling magnitude

The [orca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca) (Orcinus orca, [ork](http://www.powermobydick.com/Moby0001.html), **cá voi sát thủ, cá hổ kình**, cá heo đen lớn), or **killer whale**, is a _toothed_ whale and the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family.

The [false killer whale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_killer_whale) (cá ông chuông, Pseudorca crassidens) is a species of oceanic dolphin that is the only extant representative of the genus Pseudorca. It is found in oceans worldwide but mainly in tropical regions. It was first described in 1846 as a species of porpoise based on a skull, which was revised when the first carcasses were observed in 1861. The name "false killer whale" comes from having a skull similar to the orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale.

[Risso's dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risso%27s_dolphin) (Cá heo Risso, Grampus griseus) is a marine mammal and dolphin, the only species of the genus Grampus. Some of the most closely related species to these dolphins include: pilot whales (Globicephala spp.), pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata), melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra), and false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens).

[Pilot whales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_whale) (Chi Cá voi hoa tiêu) are cetaceans belonging to the genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, and analysis of the skulls is the best way to distinguish between the species.

The [narwhal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal) (Kỳ lân biển) is a species of toothed whale native to the Arctic. It is the only member of the genus Monodon and one of two living representatives of the family Monodontidae. The narwhal is a stocky cetacean with a relatively blunt snout, a large melon, and a shallow ridge in place of a dorsal fin.

III. the DUODECIMO WHALE

[Porpoises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise) (**Họ Cá heo chuột**) are small dolphin-like cetaceans classified under the **family Phocoenidae**. Although similar in appearance to dolphins, they are more closely related to narwhals and belugas than to the true dolphins.\
tortoise, turquoise

The [harbour porpoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_porpoise) (Phocoena phocoena) is one of eight extant species of porpoise. It is one of the smallest species of cetacean. As its name implies, it stays close to coastal areas or river estuaries, and as such, is the most familiar porpoise to whale watchers.

Plankton (sinh vật phù du) are the diverse collection of organisms that drift in water (or air) but are unable to actively propel themselves against currents (or wind). The individual organisms constituting plankton are called plankters. In the ocean, they provide a crucial source of food to many small and large aquatic organisms, such as bivalves, fish, and baleen whales.

- A maggot (giòi hay dòi) is the larva of a fly (order Diptera); it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachycera flies, such as houseflies, cheese flies, and blowflies, rather than larvae of the Nematocera, such as mosquitoes and crane flies.

A **leaf miner** is any one of numerous species of insects in which the larval stage lives in, and eats, the leaf tissue of plants.

[Mackerel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackerel) (cá thu) is a common name applied to a number of different species of pelagic fish, mostly from the family Scombridae. They are found in both temperate and tropical seas, mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment.

[Cod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod) (pl.: cod, cá tuyết) is the common name for the demersal fish genus Gadus, belonging to the family Gadidae.[1] Cod is also used as part of the common name for a number of other fish species, and one species that belongs to genus Gadus is commonly not called cod (Alaska pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus).

[Sardine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardine) (cá mòi) and pilchard are common names for various species of small, oily forage fish in the herring suborder Clupeoidei. The term 'sardine' was first used in English during the early 15th century; a somewhat dubious etymology says it comes from the Italian island of Sardinia, around which sardines were once supposedly abundant.\
