## Angiospermae Clade

[Flowering plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant) are plants that bear flowers and fruits, and form the **clade Angiospermae**, commonly called **angiosperms**. They include all forbs (flowering plants without a woody stem), grasses and grass-like plants, a vast majority of broad-leaved trees, shrubs and vines, and most aquatic plants.

The term **angiosperm** is derived from the Greek words ἀγγεῖον / angeion ('container, vessel') and σπέρμα / sperma ('seed'), meaning that the seeds are enclosed within a fruit. They are by far the _most diverse_ group of land plants.

[Rosaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosaceae) the rose family (họ hoa hồng), is a family of flowering plants that includes 4,828 known species in 91 genera.

[Rubus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus) (chi mâm xôi) is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, subfamily Rosoideae, most commonly known as **brambles**. Fruits of various species are known as raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, and bristleberries

### Monocotyledon & dicotyledon Clade

**Monocotyledons** or **Thực vật một lá mầm** commonly referred to as **monocots**, are grass and grass-like flowering plants (angiosperms), the seeds of which typically contain only one embryonic leaf, or **cotyledon**.

Most monocots are herbaceous.

**Herbaceous** (Thực vật thân thảo, thảo mộc) plants are vascular plants that have no persistent woody stems above ground. This broad category of plants includes many perennials, and nearly all annuals and biennials.  
A forb or phorb is a herbaceous flowering plant that is not a graminoid (grass, sedge, or rush).

The **dicotyledons**, also known as **dicots** (or, more rarely, dicotyls, thực vật hai lá mầm), are one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants (angiosperms) were formerly divided.

The **eudicots** or eudicotyledons are flowering plants that have two seed leaves (cotyledons) upon germination.[1] The term derives from dicotyledon (etymologically, eu = true; di = two; cotyledon = seed leaf).

## Arecales

[Ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_(botany)) - ear of corn (tai - bắp ngô).

Thực ra, từ "ear" ở đây có gốc tiếng Anh cổ, chỉ phần ra bông kết hạt của các cây ngũ cốc, khác với từ "ear" tai.

Globally, 6% of all plant species and 15% of herbaceous plants (excluding trees and shrubs) are annuals.[
