# Economic terms

[Annuitant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuitant): a person who receives a fixed sum of money yearly due to an investment.

In investment, an [annuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuity) is a series of payments made at equal intervals.[1] Examples of annuities are regular deposits to a savings account, monthly home mortgage payments, monthly insurance payments and pension payments.

In lending agreements, [collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)) (tài sản đảm bảo) is a borrower's pledge of specific property to a lender, to secure repayment of a loan. The collateral serves as a lender's protection against a borrower's default and so can be used to offset the loan if the borrower fails to pay the principal and interest satisfactorily under the terms of the lending agreement.

A [home equity loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_loan) (vay thế chấp) is a type of loan in which the borrowers use the equity of their home as collateral. The loan amount is determined by the value of the property, and the value of the property is determined by an appraiser from the lending institution.

## Bid vs ask

- Bid Price (giá mua vào, giá chào mua): The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset. This is the price you would receive if you were to sell.
- Ask Price (giá bán ra, giá chào bán): The lowest price a seller is willing to sell their asset. This is the price you would pay if you were to buy.

Khi seller's ask price == buyer's bid price thì giao dịch thành công.

Are you familiar with auction terminology? When someone bids on an item, they are offering to buy it for that price. If the person auctioning the item off isn't satisfied with the current bid, they will ask for more.  
Chính vì seller greedy ask for more nên giá bán bao giờ cũng cao hơn.
