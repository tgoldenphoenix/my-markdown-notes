A [helix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix) (pl. helices) is a shape like a cylindrical coil spring or the thread of a machine screw. It is a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis. Helices are important in biology, as the DNA molecule is formed as two intertwined helices, and many proteins have helical substructures, known as alpha helices.

An [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom), postulate, or assumption (tiên đề, định đề) is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word ἀξίωμα (axíōma), meaning 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident'.

In mathematics and formal logic, a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem) (định lý) is a statement that has been proven, or can be proven. The _proof_ of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system to establish that the theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems.
