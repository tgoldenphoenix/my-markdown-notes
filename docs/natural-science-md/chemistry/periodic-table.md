The are 07 rows (periods). Lanthanides & Actinides really belong to row 6th and 7th.

The number of element in each line are: 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32

There are total 118 elements. All elements with atomic numbers higher than uranium (92) are considered artificial or synthetic elements

There are 18 columns (or **groups**). Groups contain similar elements.  
Nếu dùng Roman number thì chỉ có 8 groups.

The gray diagonal "metal divider" on the periodic table is a stair-step line that separates metals from nonmetals, with metalloids positioned along the line. This line is not a formal chemical boundary, but rather a visual convention to illustrate the general trend in properties across the periodic table.

Metals on the left and non-metals on the right.
