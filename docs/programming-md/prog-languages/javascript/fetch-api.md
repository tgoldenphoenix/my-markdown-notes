# Fetch API & Axios

Fetch is the modern replacement for `XMLHttpRequest`: unlike XMLHttpRequest, which uses callbacks, Fetch is promise-based.

The `fetch()` function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing the server's response. You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.

```javascript
async function getData() {
  const url = "https://example.org/products.json";
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}
```
